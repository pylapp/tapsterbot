# Important notice

This GitHub repository is a fork of the original [Jason Huggin's tapsterbot](https://github.com/hugs/tapsterbot) project.
It contains also improvements (direct or not) from [Dan Cuellar's fork](https://github.com/penguinho/tapsterbot).
Some part of this project have been implemented by myself in my leasure time or work time [Orange], see sources headers for more details.

Several years ago, I noticed the Git history was crappy and fucked up.
Thee were some data leaks, wrong email address was used, got a lot of spam, commits links to the GitHub account's were not created because of bad pseudo... No DCO, no GPG-signing, too heavy files were versioned...
It was a big mess. Trials to clean the history failed, that is the reason why the project was deleted and created again.
Yep, newbie failure between 2016 and 2019, don't remember well. I am not proud at all, and that case is a "good" example for my students (>_<)

# Tapster - Mobile Automation Robot

![A Taspter2 bot](poster.png)

## Why using such bot?
- Bring fun in your office
- Bring automation for your tests
- Extend your software-based instrumented tests (using UI Automator, Espresso, Kakao, Appium or whatever) with hardware-based tests
- Improve quality of your products
- Deal with secured elements on which no software can click
- Be as close as possible of the ideal use case (users use their fingers to click :3)
- Get a new tool for software development and mobile app tests: robots!

## Wanna help?
 - Make an iOS app to drive the robot
 - Add controls in server-side and clients-side to prevent the use of bad parameters (i.e. tap on with x=-42 and y=0.666)
 - Plug a camera to the robot to stream the tests
 - Draw a SVG on your screen (or pick it from your files) and send its XML content to the server so as to make the robot paint the thing :)
 - Integrate Snips assistants within the Progressive Web Apps
 - Define actions in Snips assistants
 - Integrate the use of Tapster inside Appium
 - Deal with coordinates based on landscape mode of devices
